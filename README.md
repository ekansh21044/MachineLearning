Liver diseases are increasing worldwide, year by year, especially in India, and this poses a huge challenge to public health as the detection methods are costly and compromise the treatments. To tackle this, we want to develop an affordable machine-learning model for Liver Disease Prediction so that it will be helpful in the field of healthcare and medicine.
The traditional diagnostic methods for liver diseases are not only expensive but are also limited to the upper class only and are not affordable and require a high amount of resources, so diagnosis is delayed to late-stage, making the condition critical.
